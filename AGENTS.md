# Sticky Todo Repository Guide

This file is the central Codex instruction file for this repository.

If `CLAUDE.md` also exists, keep the tracking sections aligned and treat `AGENTS.md` as the Codex-first source of truth.

## Source Of Truth

When documents disagree, use this precedence:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/architecture.md`
3. `docs/development-plan.md`
4. `docs/todo.md`
5. `docs/changelog.md`
6. `README.md`

## Project Tracking Documents

All tracking docs live in `docs/`. Detailed implementation plans live in `docs/plans/`.

### Document Inventory

| File | Purpose | When to Read | When to Update |
|------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| `docs/todo.md` | High-level task list grouped by phase, linked to plan files | Start of session to pick up work | After completing or discovering tasks |
| `docs/plans/N-name.md` | Detailed breakdown of a buildable unit | When working on that plan | Check off sub-tasks as you complete them |
| `docs/changelog.md` | Log of completed work, latest first | Before starting work to avoid redoing it | After every meaningful change |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Tech stack, directory layout, conventions, patterns | Before writing code | When adding modules, changing structure, or setting new patterns |
| `docs/bugs.md` | Known issues, failed approaches, workarounds | Before debugging or proposing risky changes | When discovering bugs or failed approaches |
| `docs/development-plan.md` | Vision, roadmap, and current delivery focus | At session start when scope matters | Only when scope, milestones, or priorities change |
| `README.md` | User-facing overview, setup, and usage | Before changing user-facing behavior | When setup, commands, or product surface changes |
| `docs/llm-api-guide.md` | Optional LLM-facing API or DSL reference | Before writing agent-facing examples or contracts | Update it whenever callable surfaces, schemas, or examples change |

## Session Start Protocol

1. Read `docs/todo.md`
2. Read the active plan in `docs/plans/`
3. Read the latest entries in `docs/changelog.md`
4. Read `docs/architecture.md`
5. Read `docs/development-plan.md` only when the task touches scope or roadmap decisions

## After Each Modification

- Update the active plan file and check off finished sub-tasks
- Update `docs/todo.md` to reflect completed or newly discovered work
- Add a new top entry to `docs/changelog.md`
- Update `docs/architecture.md` when layout, patterns, or dependencies change
- Update `docs/bugs.md` when you hit a bug or abandon an approach
- Update `docs/development-plan.md` only when priorities or milestones change
- Update `README.md` when setup, commands, or user-facing behavior changes
- If present, update `docs/llm-api-guide.md` when callable surfaces, schemas, or examples change

## Plan Files

Plans use hierarchical numbering that mirrors the task tree:

```text
plans/
  1-name.md
  1-1-name.md
  1-2-name.md
  2-name.md
  2-1-name.md
  2-1-1-name.md
```

Top-level plans omit a parent link. Sub-plans link back to their parent. Create deeper levels only when the work is active.

### Plan File Format

```markdown
# 1-1: Sub-Plan Title

**Parent:** [1-name](1-name.md)
**Status:** not-started | in-progress | completed
**Goal:** One sentence describing what this plan achieves.

## Tasks
- [ ] 1. Task
  - [ ] 1-1. Sub-task
  - [ ] 1-2. Sub-task
- [ ] 2. Task

## Decisions
- (filled in during execution)

## Notes
- (filled in during execution)
```

### Todo Format

```markdown
# Todo

## Phase 0 - Phase Name
- [x] [1-name](plans/1-name.md) - brief description
  - [x] [1-1-name](plans/1-1-name.md)
  - [ ] [1-2-name](plans/1-2-name.md)
- [ ] 2: Description -> (not yet planned)

## Backlog
- [ ] Task description
```

## Rules

- Keep each document concise
- Keep changelog entries in descending order and never delete old entries
- Keep failed approaches in `docs/bugs.md` so the repo does not repeat them
- Expand plan depth just in time
- When in doubt, update the docs

## Project Notes

- This repository is a Tauri desktop app with a React/Vite frontend and a Rust native layer.
- The active recovery plan is `docs/plans/4-9-data-history-recovery-and-merge.md`; remaining follow-up questions live in `docs/todo.md` backlog.
- The Star Focus design lock lives in `docs/plans/1-star-focus-integration-design.md`; implementation should stay consistent with those v1 decisions unless that plan is explicitly revised.
